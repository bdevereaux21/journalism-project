<p>Writing can be tricky if you don't take certain steps to set yourself up for success. These tips will help prepare you to understand how to write in a comfortable, stress-free setting.</p>

</br>

 <div class="doublediv">
 <h1>Things You'll Need:</h1>
 <ul>
 <li> A distraction free room with proper writing</li>
 <li> A comfortable chair and desk to sit at</li>
 <li> A speaker or device that can play music</li>
 <li> Your favorite beverage (typically tea, coffee, or water)</li>
 <li> A laptop charger</li>
 <li> A candle or oil diffuser</li>
 </ul>
 
 </div>
 </br>
 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Step 1: Find a Place to Write</h1>
 <p> This may seem obvious, but it is important to find a building or room that will not be distracting while you write. You need a place that will allow ideas and words to flow from your brain to your fingers without interruption. For many this is a quiet room without the presence of other people and an adequate source of light. However, if like to feel the breeze and the sunshine on your face, find a quiet place outdoors that will give you the inspiration you’re looking for!

 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Step 2: Get Comfortable</h1>
 <p> How could someone be expected to write a great piece if they don’t have somewhere comfortable to sit? A good office chair or loveseat will help you to stay relaxed while keeping your back supported. If you are writing on a laptop and do not enjoy resting it on your legs, make sure you have a table or desk to set it on that sits at a level suited for your typing needs.
 </p>

 </br>
 
 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Step 3: Play Some Tunes</h1>
 <p> Studies have found that smooth music without words like jazz or classical music can actually help productivity. It can also help to keep you relaxed and focused. It is easy to get distracted while writing, and music can help to lock you into your zone and keep your mind occupied.

 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Step 4: Grab a Drink</h1>
 <p> It’s easy to find reasons to leave your work station that could make you lose focus. If you have your drink already with you, then that means less trips to the kitchen. Obviously it is good to drink water throughout the day, but if you need a little caffeine boost to get you through work, coffee or tea is a healthy choice to give your brain the juice it needs. (Still be sure to keep water with you along with your additional caffeine beverage)

 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Step 5: Plug it In</h1>
 <p> Don’t lose your progress or your train of thought because your laptop dies and make sure you have your charger nearby. Depending on where you are sitting, it may be a good idea to keep it charging while you write just to be safe!

 <div class="steps">
 <h1> Optional: Pick a scent</h1>
 <p> Having the right smell in your writing area can also help you to stay cool, calm, and collected. Grab a candle or oil diffuser with your favorite scent and keep it near your work station. Lavender, lemon, and vanilla are all great choices for settle, soothing scents.
